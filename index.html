            <h2>About</h2>
            <h3>What is it?</h3>
            <p>
                This page contains a series of small games, some are work in progress, others are simple products.
                The website itself acts as a cumulative project to show the knowledge I have aquired during my first quarter at ACS.
            </p>
            <h3>Why?</h3>
            <p>
                From playing to making, games have been a passion of mine from the very beginning.
                With the tools I've aquired from the ACS program, I've been able to explore new game programming
                concepts and make functional prototypes to play and enjoy all while refining my coding skills.
            </p>
            <h3>Why Phaser and Pygame?</h3>
            <p>
                I started with the Pygame API for its rendering and math capabilities allowing me to create some great game bases. 
                With time though, the lack of modern support for the API, substantial boiler plate, and difficulty to share
                drove me to switch. Although not as quick to code, the Phaser API for Javascript possesses incredible functionaliy,
                more resources, and ridiculously easy shareablilty.
            </p>
