            <h2>About</h2>
            <h3>What is Simple GameDev?</h3>
            <p>
                This page contains a series of small games, some are work in progress, others are simple products.
                The website itself acts as a cumulative project to show the knowledge I have aquired during my first quarter at ACS.
            </p>
            <h3>Why?</h3>
            <p>
                From playing to making, games have been a passion of mine from the very beginning.
                With the tools I've aquired from the ACS program, I've been able to explore new game programming
                concepts and make functional prototypes to play and enjoy all while refining my coding skills.
            </p>
            <h3>Phaser and Pygame</h3>
            <p>
                I started with the Pygame API for its rendering and math capabilities allowing me to create some great game bases. 
                Python's accessablity made testing concepts and making features quick and easy.
                With time though, the lack of modern support for the API, substantial boiler plate, and difficulty to share
                drove me to switch to Phaser. Although not as quick to code, the Phaser API for Javascript boasts incredible functionaliy,
                more resources, and ridiculously easy shareablilty. All these factors plus the drive to push myself into new challenges
                made Phaser the clear choice for me.
